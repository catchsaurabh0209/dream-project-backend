# Dream Project

The Dream project is a backend application developed using Spring Boot that provides endpoints for storing dream stories and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these stories. It serves as the backend service for managing dream stories.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: The project supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for dream stories.
- **RESTful API**: It exposes RESTful endpoints to interact with dream stories.
- **Persistence**: Dream stories are stored in a database, ensuring data durability and reliability.
<!-- - **Security**: Implements basic security measures to protect endpoints and ensure authorized access to the API. -->

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based applications, providing features like auto-configuration and embedded web server.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies database interactions and provides repository support.
- **Hibernate**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for mapping Java objects to database tables.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system for storing dream stories.
<!-- - **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization features to secure the API endpoints. -->
- **Maven**: Dependency management tool for managing project dependencies and building the project.
<!-- - **JUnit**: Testing framework for unit testing the application components. -->

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the Dream project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Dream project repository from GitHub:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dream-project.git
    ```

2. **Configure the Database**: Update the database configuration properties in `application.properties` file with your MySQL database credentials:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dream_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    ```

3. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and build the project using Maven:

    ```
    cd dream-project
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. **Run the Application**: Run the Spring Boot application using Maven:

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

5. **Access the API**: The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`. You can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or any HTTP client.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/dreams**: Retrieve all dream stories.
- **GET /api/dreams/{id}**: Retrieve a specific dream story by its ID.
- **POST /api/dreams**: Create a new dream story.
- **PUT /api/dreams/{id}**: Update an existing dream story.
- **DELETE /api/dreams/{id}**: Delete a dream story by its ID.

<!-- ## Authentication

The Dream project implements basic authentication for securing the API endpoints. Users need to authenticate themselves before accessing the protected resources. You can configure users, roles, and access permissions based on your requirements. -->
